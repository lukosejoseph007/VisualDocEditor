# Vision Document: AI-Powered Document Editing & Management Tool

## Overview

We envision a **desktop application** similar in appearance and user experience to VS Code, but specialized for document management and AI-assisted editing. The tool will allow users to open, read, edit, create, and manage multiple types of documents within a folder structure, with seamless AI integration for advanced editing and content generation.

## Core Objectives

* Provide a **desktop application** (cross-platform: Windows, Mac, Linux) with VS Code–like usability.
* Enable **AI-assisted document editing**, including grammar correction, formatting, and applying style templates.
* Support **multiple file formats**: text files, Markdown, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, PDF, HTML, and others.
* Allow editing of both **editable documents** (e.g., .docx, .md, .txt) and **non-editable documents** (e.g., .pdf) by converting them into an editable representation.
* Integrate with multiple **LLMs (via APIs like OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)** for flexibility and choice.
* Provide a **developer-like workflow**, with command-line access (`text .`) to open a folder in the app.

## Key Features

### File & Folder Management

* Open an entire folder with a terminal command (e.g., `text .`) similar to VS Code’s `code .`.
* Read, edit, save, create, rename, and delete files within the folder.
* AI-powered file indexing for quick search and reference.
* Support for structured projects and document libraries.

### Document Editing

* **Word & Office Documents (.docx, .pptx, .xlsx):**

  * Grammar and spell-checking via AI.
  * Apply consistent styles based on templates.
  * Reformatting sections for clarity and compliance.
* **PDFs:**

  * Open PDFs by rendering or extracting text/XML-like structure.
  * Edit via structured representations.
  * Save/export back to PDF.
* **Markdown, HTML, Text Files:**

  * Direct editing with AI-assisted rewriting.
  * Format conversion (e.g., Markdown → Word, Word → PDF).

### AI Integration

* Single **AI extension/plugin** that powers all document interactions.
* Connects to multiple LLM providers via APIs (OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).
* AI can:

  * Edit documents directly.
  * Generate new content (e.g., reports, proposals, formatted docs).
  * Refactor or restructure documents.
  * Automate repetitive tasks (apply templates, fix formatting).

### Terminal & Commands

* Built-in **terminal** for executing shell commands inside the app.
* Support AI-augmented commands:

  * `create file Report.docx with APA style`
  * `delete file notes.md`
  * `summarize all meeting transcripts in this folder`
* AI suggestions directly in the terminal or command palette.

### User Experience

* VS Code–like UI (explorer sidebar, editor window, integrated terminal).
* Minimal learning curve for developers and knowledge workers.
* AI suggestions appear as inline edits, chat interface, or side panel.

## Possible Tech Stack

* **Core App:** Based on **Electron** (like VS Code), or a fork of VS Code.
* **Document Parsing & Editing:**

  * `docx4j` / `python-docx` for Word.
  * `pdfplumber` / `PDF.js` for PDFs.
  * `openpyxl` for Excel.
  * `python-pptx` for PowerPoint.
* **AI Integration:** OpenRouter API, OpenAI API, Anthropic API, etc.
* **Indexing & Search:** SQLite or lightweight DB with AI embedding search.

## Example Use Cases

1. **Academic Workflows:** Researcher opens a folder of articles (PDF, Word) → AI summarizes, formats, and applies citation styles.
2. **Business Documentation:** Consultant opens client folder → AI fixes formatting in proposals, generates executive summaries, and ensures style compliance.
3. **Content Creation:** Writer opens drafts → AI edits grammar, restructures sections, and outputs publication-ready documents.

## Long-Term Vision

* Expand beyond document editing to include **knowledge management**.
* Build collaborative features (multi-user editing with AI assistance).
* Offer **cloud sync** for cross-device work.
* Become the **AI-native replacement/companion to MS Office + VS Code** for document workflows.
